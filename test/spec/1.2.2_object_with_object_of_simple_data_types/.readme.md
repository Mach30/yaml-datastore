### Object with Object of Simple Data Types

This use case demonstrates storing an object that contains an object that contains simple data types.

#### The Model to Store

In this case, `address` references an object that contains only simple data. 

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Generated Directory Structure

As with all objects, the generated data structure for this example starts with a directory named `model` and the file `_this.yaml`. Because this object contains an object, there is now a sub-directory named `address` named after the object and contains its own `_this.yaml` file.

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Generated Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`
!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

In this file, we use the convention of enclosing the filename in double parentheses, `address/_this.yaml` to reference the file storing the object. 

##### `model/address/_this.yaml`                            
!include(model/address/_this.yaml lang=txt)

This yaml file stores the object, and because the object only has simple data types, we can store it as a single file.
